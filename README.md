# µC.js
A simple, high-level, JavaScript library for the µCollective.org API.

Just a placeholder file _and repository_ until µCollective.org's API is ready to roll.

Buuut, I should probably write up the documentation as I go, so here it is:

## Let's go

To use µC.js add this to your document:
```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="uC.min.js"></script>
```

Now you're pretty much ready to go.

## uC.audio
An example usage would be:
```JavaScript
uC.audio.rand({
	amount: 1,
	success: function(response) {
		console.log(response);
	},
	error: function(e) {
		alert('Oops: ' + e.error);
	}
});
```
A possible return would be:
```JSON
{"author":"crab","avatar":"http://ucollective.org/items/av/crab.jpg","comment_count":8,"description":"From my white room, from my lovely LSDJ, ","extlink":null,"favourite_count":7,"file":"http://ucollective.org/items/music/crab - ChinaGirl-Crabsound.mp3","frontpage":true,"id":2090,"licensing":{"img":["by.png"],"short":"(BY)","text":"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","url":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"},"plays":20,"soundcloud":"http://soundcloud.com/cangrejo-music","time":1371437157,"title":"China Girl - Crab sound","url":"http://ucollective.org/audio/crab/china+girl-crab+sound/"}
```
Inside the success callback function given to the rand function we can access the data like so:
```JavaScript
console.log(response.author); // Logs 'crab' in your JavaScript console
console.log(response.licensing.text); // Logs 'Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported' in your JavaScript console
console.log(response.frontpage); // Logs true in your JavaScript console
```

### .all(allObj)
Returns the 40 newest Audio submissions in an Array. Use the **page** variable to go back to the next 40 results.
```JavaScript
var allObj = {
	page: 1,
	success: function(data){},
	warn: function(w){},
	error: function(e){}
}
uC.audio.all(ajjObj);
```
```JSON

## uC.visual
The Visual request functions are identical, they just return Visual submissions rather than Audio submissions.

## uC.comment.*.get
>The .get is appended because of the future API write requests (yet to be added) - then, after authentication, you'd be able to use .write (or something similar) to write a comment to a submission.

###.audio(audioComObj)
Returns, if any, the comments on an Audio submission as an Array.

Throws a warning if no comments are available.
```JavaScript
var audioComObj = {
	id: 1,
	success: function(data){},
	warn: function(w){},
	error: function(e){}
}
uC.comment.audio.get(audioComObj);
```
